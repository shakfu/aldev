# psnd Documentation

This directory contains documentation for psnd, a polyglot editor and REPL for music programming languages.

## Language Guides

psnd supports four music programming languages, each with its own paradigm:

| Language | Paradigm | Guide |
|----------|----------|-------|
| [Alda](alda/) | Declarative music notation | [alda/README.md](alda/README.md) |
| [Joy](joy/) | Concatenative (stack-based) | [joy/README.md](joy/README.md) |
| [TR7 Scheme](tr7/) | Functional (Lisp/Scheme) | [tr7/README.md](tr7/README.md) |
| [Bog](bog/) | Logic programming (Prolog-based) | [bog/README.md](bog/README.md) |

## Quick Comparison

### Alda - Declarative Notation

Write music as you would on sheet music:

```alda
piano:
  (tempo 120)
  c4 d e f | g a b > c
```

Best for: Traditional composition, readable scores, multi-instrument arrangements.

### Joy - Stack-Based

Compose using postfix operations on a stack:

```joy
120 tempo
[c d e f g] play
c major chord
```

Best for: Algorithmic composition, pattern manipulation, functional transformations.

### TR7 Scheme - Functional

Use Scheme's expressiveness for music:

```scheme
(set-tempo 120)
(play-seq '(60 62 64 65 67) 80 250)
(play-chord '(60 64 67) 80 500)
```

Best for: Complex algorithms, recursive structures, Lisp enthusiasts.

### Bog - Logic Programming

Define musical events through declarative rules:

```prolog
event(kick, 36, 0.9, T) :- every(T, 1.0).
event(hat, 42, 0.5, T) :- every(T, 0.25).
```

Best for: Generative music, pattern-based rhythms, live coding with named slots.

## Common Features

All languages share:

- **Non-blocking async playback** - REPLs remain responsive during playback
- **Virtual MIDI ports** - Create named ports for routing to DAWs
- **Built-in synthesis** - TinySoundFont for standalone playback
- **Csound backend** - Advanced synthesis (optional build)
- **Ableton Link** - Tempo sync with other applications
- **Editor integration** - Syntax highlighting and live evaluation
- **Lua scripting** - Automation and customization

## Getting Started

1. **Install**: Build psnd with `make` (or `make csound` for Csound support)

2. **Choose a language**: Pick based on your preferred paradigm
   - Notation-based? Try **Alda**
   - Stack-based/functional? Try **Joy**
   - Lisp fan? Try **TR7 Scheme**
   - Logic programming/live coding? Try **Bog**

3. **Start the REPL**:

   ```bash
   psnd alda    # Alda REPL
   psnd joy     # Joy REPL
   psnd tr7     # TR7 Scheme REPL
   psnd bog     # Bog REPL
   ```

4. **Edit files**:

   ```bash
   psnd song.alda   # Open in editor
   psnd song.joy
   psnd song.scm
   psnd song.bog
   ```

5. **Play files**:

   ```bash
   psnd play song.alda   # Headless playback
   ```

## REPL Commands

Common commands work across all REPLs:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:h` | Show help |
| `:q` | Quit |
| `:s` | Stop playback |
| `:l` | List MIDI ports |
| `:sf PATH` | Load soundfont |
| `:link on` | Enable Ableton Link |

See individual language guides for language-specific commands.

## Editor Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl-E` | Evaluate current part/line |
| `Ctrl-P` | Play entire file |
| `Ctrl-G` | Stop playback |
| `Ctrl-S` | Save |
| `Ctrl-L` | Lua console |
